Nowadays, time has become more of an essence, so people value efficiency on all fronts highly. This project was aimed at developing an efficient and intelligent parking garage with an automatic payment and reservation tool. Sadly, often this efficiency comes at the expense of the user's privacy. That is why this paper also looks into the question: ``How can a garage be as secure as possible, without reducing its efficiency?"

A scale model of a real life parking garage was built alongside a functional application, to deliver a proof of concept in this report. Via usage of \ac{anpr} and \ac{iot} devices, the garage able to detect entering and leaving cars and calculate the amount each car owner has to pay. This payment can happen automatically, but only if allowed by the user. Via a self built application can the user make reservations for a garage, see the available parking lots at any time and activate or pay the garage bills. The entire system is built with privacy and security as its primary goal.

All of this adds to the efficiency as well as the privacy and security of the garage, since most time consuming things can be done in advance or happen automatically.
